% Organize fluorescence dF/F0 signals per track for each ROI.
% 
% Each track has a set of trials. For each ROI calculate dF/F0 for all 
% trials of each track. Signals are binned either by distance or time steps
% 
% Inputs

%   VRlab : structure with fields:
%       Each field is a vector of size [1, nSamples]

%       - licks
%       - actlab
%   displmnt : vector [1, nSamples]
%       Cumulative total distance travelled (displacement) since the start 
%       of the recording (cm)
%   vel : vector [1, nSamples]
%       Instantaneous velocity (cm/s)
%   lagTime : vector [1, nSamples]
%       Instantaneous frame by frame lag in VR (seconds)
%        
% Inputs (optional)
% ----------------
%   binnr :  vector [1, numTracks]   (Default: [48, 48, 64, 64, 96, 96])
%       Each element is the number of bins for each track number(see below) 
%       Default for tracks of length 120, 160 or 240 cm
%       Bins are 2.5cm
%   trackNums : vector [1, numTracks]   (Default: [1,2,3,5,7,8])
%       Requested tracks (VR world number, set by Virmen)
%   binBy : string   (Default: 'distance')   
%       Possible values = 'distance' , 'time'
%   dataTrialsOnly : boolean   (Default: false)
%       Return only trials with data (remove nan trials of other tracks or
%       categories)
%   useHitsOnly : boolean   (Default: false)
%       Some descript
%   useMissOnly : boolean   (Default: false)
